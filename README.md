# 42cursus

## Summary

This repository contains most of my journey through the 42 programming campus experience. 
Here you can find all the projects I have handed in as part of the cursus, except for group projects.

## What is 42

42 is a programming school with an innovative pedagogical approach, which involves peer-learning as the main drive in improving one's abilities.
A majority of the mandatory projects are developed using C and C++, and there is a strong focus on fundamentals, such as data structures, algorithms, and an emphasis on testing and clean coding practices.
You can read more about it [here](https://42.fr/en/homepage).

## Disclaimer for other students

This repository exists as proof of the effort I have dedicated to 42.
It is not meant to be used as a guide or cheatsheet to do any of the projects.
In fact, I heavily discourage using any code from this repository in your own projects, as it goes against the 42 rulebook and it will also greatly devalue your personal experience.

You have been warned; use this repository at your own risk.
